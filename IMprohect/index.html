<br><br><br><br><h3 id="text">So, you are viewing this website via laptop and you must have wondered(about computers) "When did it all start?".<br>you have come to the right place.<br>The first ever desktop computer was ENIAC made in 1946. It was quite big<br>Its speed was 100kHz.<br>It had no monitor(ISNT THAT CRAZY). <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<h1 id="text">The First OS[operating System]</h1>
<h3 id ="text">The first operating system was <b>GM-NAA I/O</b><br>The GM-NAA I/O input/output system of General Motors and North American Aviation was the first operating system for the IBM 704 computer.<br>The main function of GM-NAA I/O was to automatically execute a new program once the one that was being executed had finished (batch processing). It was formed of shared routines to the programs that provided common access to the input/output devices<br>

<h1 id="text">Something About Intel</h1>
<h3 id = "text">The first Intel processor was C4004.<br>The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. Sold for US$60, it was the first commercially produced microprocessor, and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs.<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="text">On September 20, 1989, Apple gave the world its first-ever battery-powered laptop.<br> The Macintosh Portable was unveiled in Universal City, California, by Jean-Louis Gassée, the then Product Chief at the tech giant.<br> The vision was to offer a portable Mac that was just as useful and powerful as Apple’s desktop machines
</h3><br><br><br>
<h3 id="text">The Macintosh was introduced by a television commercial entitled "1984" shown during Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984[6] and directed by Ridley Scott. Sales of the Macintosh were strong from its initial release on January 24, 1984, and reached 70,000 units on May 3, 1984. Upon the release of its successor, the Macintosh 512K, it was rebranded as the Macintosh 128K. The computer's model number was M0001.</h3>

<h1 id="text">Robert Noyce and Moore</h1>
<h3 id="text">In July 1968, Robert Noyce and Moore founded NM Electronics, which later became Intel Corporation. Moore served as executive vice president until 1975 when he became president. In April 1979, Moore became chairman and chief executive officer, holding that position until April 1987, when he became chairman. He was named chairman emeritus in 1997.[20] Under Noyce, Moore, and later Andrew Grove, Intel has pioneered new technologies in the areas of computer memory, integrated circuits, and microprocessor design.</h3>

<h1 id="text">The Rise of AMD</h1>
<h3 id ="text">When Amd started the processors of it were bad and used to heat up easily<br>But in recent years AMD has been great and its on demand,<br>Some people choose AMD above Intel<br></h3>

<h1 id="text">generation of computers, time line</h1><br><br>
<h3 id = "text">First Generation Computers (1940-1956)<br>
Second Generation Computers (1946-1959)<br>
Third Generation Computers (1964-1971)<br>
Fourth Generation Computers (1971-1980)<br>
Fifth Generation Computers (1982-1992)<br></h3>
<br><br>

<h1 id="text">First generation</h1><br> 
<h3 id="text"><br>1946-1959 is the period of first generation computer. J.P.Eckert and J.W.<br> Mauchy invented the first successful electronic computer called ENIAC, ENIAC stands for “Electronic Numeric Integrated And Calculator</h3>
<br><h1 id ="text">Second Generation</h1><br>
<h3 id="text">The second generation of computers consists of two types of devices, transistors, and magnetic core.<br> The transistors helped to develop a better computer than the first generation computers consisting of vacuum tubes.<br> Some second generation of computers are IBM 1920, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, IBM 1401, etc</h3>
<br><br><h1 id="text">Third Generation</h1><br><br>
<h3 id="text">The third generation computer was started in 1965 and ended around 1971.<br> Third generation computers start using integrated circuits instead of transistors.<br> The integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor material, that contains thousands of transistors miniaturized in it.</h3>
<br><br><h1 id="text">Fourth Generation</h1><br><br>
<h3 id ="text">Fourth Generation of computers was between 1971 – 1980.<br> These computers used the VLSI technology or the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology.<br> Therefore they were also known as the microprocessors.</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h1 id="text">Fifth Generation</h1><br><br>
<h3 id="text">The Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) was a 10-year initiative begun in 1982 by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming.
<br>Features of fifth-generation computers are :
<br>Use of Artificial Intelligence.
<br>Use of optical fiber in circuits.
<br>Development of the elements of programs.
<br>Use of Natural language.
<br>Magnetic enabled bio-chips<br>
</h3>
<br><br>
<h1 id="text">Sixth Generation</h1><br>
<h3 id="text">Sixth generation (future generations)
As of 2022, most still consider us to be in the fifth generation as AI continues to develop. One possible contender for a future sixth generation is the quantum computer. However, until quantum computing becomes more developed and widely used, it is still only a promising idea</h3>
